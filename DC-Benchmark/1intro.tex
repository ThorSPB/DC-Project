\chapter{Introduction}

HappyMark is a benchmarking tool written in Java code that test the CPU and the memory .

\section{Context}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We have made an application that tests the CPU's reading, computation, and writing speed by running a loop.
  \item The app also tests how fast the communication between the CPU and RAM is.
  \item We are also testing storage memory by testing how fast we can read and write from files.
  
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item One would choose our app because it is easy to use, it clearly displays how much time it takes to run the test, and compares your result with the average result.
  
  \item This tool was inspired by Cinebench and UserBenchmark. We like how UserBenchmark displays its results and decided to do something similar. We run the test and then compare the time it took to finish with a reference.

\end{itemize}
