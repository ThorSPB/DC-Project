\chapter{Introduction}

This chapter should not contain more than one page in this context. Under other circumstances, the introduction should contain more aspects and should be more detailed, but, in this case, even one-half of 
one page is perfect. :) 

\section{Context}

\begin{itemize}
  \item What have you done? -- a short description of chosen benchmark application
  \item  Which component and what specific functionality (or functionalities) are you testing?

\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the motivation behind choosing this application?
  
  \item What is your project about? Is it something completely new, is it a combination of two or more existing benchmarks, or is it simply a great feature added to an already existing idea/method?

\end{itemize}
