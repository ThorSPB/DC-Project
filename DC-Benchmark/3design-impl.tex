\chapter{Design and implementation} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item  First of all, we followed the template offered by the project sheets. We used Java as a programming language and IntelliJ as IDE. We created functionalities for the bench, logging and the timing, whom are the base of a benchmark. Offers the measure in time(nanoseconds), and we used the package approach for each piece that we needed in order to knock down the benchmark in a organised way.
  
  \item \textbf{Briefly} describe the used algorithms and other \textbf{special features}. Do not add source code (entire files), \textbf{only} short snippets \textbf{if you feel they are relevant}, and if you want to emphasize anything. In order to test the functionality, we created a "Dummy Benchmark" in order to test the overall functionality:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Dummy: complete a array of N elements with random values
      \item Demo: take N random integers between 0 - 1000 and perform bubble sort
      \item CPU: perform the addition of all prime numbers upon a upper limit
      \item Sleep: the same as CPU but with a different run condition, with a "sleep" time added.
  \end{itemize}
